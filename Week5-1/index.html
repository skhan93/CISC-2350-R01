<!-- Miracle Mikes Story  -->
		<p>Mike the Headless Chicken was a Wyandotte chicken that had its head cut off when its owner Lloyd Olsen missed the jugular vein, leaving one ear and most of the brain stem intact. Even though the axe cut off the bulk of the head Mike, the chicken was still able to balance itself and even walk. When Olsen realized that Mike did not die he decided to keep it alive by feeding it a mixture of milk and water via an eyedropper, and gave it small grains of corn. Another vital bodily function they helped with was clearing mucus from his throat. They fed him with a dropper, and cleared his throat with a syringe. In March 1947(18 months since Miracle Mikes journey), at a motel in Phoenix while traveling home from tour, Mike started choking in the middle of the night and died.</p><br>

		<h3>What Happens When A Chickens Head Is Cut Off?</h3>

		<ul>
				<li>Beheading disconnects the brain from the rest of the body, but for a short period the spinal cord circuits still have residual oxygen. </li>

				<li>Without input from the brain these circuits start spontaneously. "The neurons become active, the legs start moving," says Dr Tom Smulders of Newcastle University.</li>

				<li>Usually the chicken is lying down when this happens, but in rare cases, neurons will fire a motor programme of running.

				<li>The chicken will indeed run for a little while," says Smulders. "But not for 18 months, more like 15 minutes or so."</li

</li>
