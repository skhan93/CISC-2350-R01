				<!-- How the JetBack was inspired -->
			<h3>In the beginning stages of the Jetback reasearchers combined the specs of an ordinary jetpack along with all the necesary medical equipment contained inside of an ambulance to spark the idea of a mobile emergency unit</h3>

			<br>
			

			<h3>The JetBack offers users a wide variety of tools to aid EMT's or other emergency respondents in various situations when unforseen circumstances arise.</h3>

			<br>
			<!-- Scenarios the invention would be of use in -->
			<h3>For example during the aftermath of a severe hurricane or tsunami displaced unconscious denizens might be trapped underneath the flood of water surrounding the area, with the use of the JetBack one would be able to scan for lifesigns within the water and aid anyone close to drowning. Also with the flooded water the Jetback would make it easier to navigate, hovering above the affected area granting a larger view making it easier to search for survivors. </h3>

			<br>

			<h3>The Jetback has been tested for safety and have passes all rules and regulations to be used in the USA only. The JetPack runs on organic fuel made from only plastic which causes no harm to the environment.  </h3>
