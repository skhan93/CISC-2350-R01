			<h3>In the beginning stages of the Jetback reasearchers combined the specs of an ordinary jetpack along with all the necesary medical equipment contained inside of an ambulance to spark the idea of a mobile emergency unit</h3>
			</div>

			<h3>The JetBack offers users a wide variety of tools to aid EMT's or other emergency respondents various situations when unforseen circumstances arise.</h3>

			<h3>For example during the aftermath of a severe hurricane or tsunami displaced unconscious denizens might be trapped underneath the flood of water surrounding the area, with the use of the JetBack one would be able to scan for lifesigns within the water and aid anyone close to drowning</h3>
