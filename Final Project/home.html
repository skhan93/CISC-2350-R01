<!-- explanation of the court -->

    <div> Any basketball court you will play on will be similar to this one on ur right. The only differences may be the rim height and the distance from the base line to the 3-point line. On each half of the court, there is a three-point line, which is an arced line painted on the floor. Within the three-point line, you find the key, which consists of the free-throw line and free-throw lane. The lane is sometimes called "the paint."


    
    Behind the free-throw line there is a semicircle. The top of this semicircle is referred to as the top of the key. Along each side of the lane, there are four hash marks. These are called blocks, and designate spots where players must stand during foul shots.</div>

    <p>Basketball Basics- The Rules, Concepts, Definitions, and Play Positions
    Welcome to Hoop and Learn, the perfect place for beginners to start playing basketball and intermediates to improve their ability and find new ways to hone their skills. Basketball can be played anywhere as long as there is a hoop mounted to a pole or wall and of course a basketball to shoot through it. People split up in to 2 teams and try to do two things.
    <br></br>
    1) Get the ball through the opposing team's basket as much as possible (offense)
    <br></br>
    2) Stop the opposing team from doing the same thing (defense)</p>

    <!-- image of defenders defending -->

    <div>The people inside the three point line are preventing the other team from scoring by using a defenive strategy called man to man.</div>

    <p>As soon as one team has the ball, that team is the offense and the other team is the defense. The offense tries to position players to take a shot (throw the ball through the hoop). The defense players position themselves to block these shots. Offense players move around the basket and cut past defense players (abruptly changing direction to get past the defense) until they can get a fairly high percentage shot.

    <br>Sayed Khan</h2>
    <p>Mr. Khan has been an avid fan of basketball since the age of 7 years old. He has been a fan of the Oklahoma City Thunder organization since 2005. His passion for basketball was ignited when his cousin Shadman introduced him to OKC Thunder iconic duo which made Sayed fall in love with the quickness and agility that the dynamic duo consisting of Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant played with in their playoff run in 2009-2010. His interest in sports grew even further when he became the team manager/assistant of his high school basketball team which allowed him to work closely with the coach and help the team understand plays and how to execute them accurately. Sayed still loves to play basketball and create his own plays and wants to coach a basketball team in the near future. His admiration for the game of basketball led to the creation of this website. Sayed believes basketball is more than just a game and allows people from all over to enjoy something together. He wants basketball to become the most popular sport in the world allowing everyone access to the joys of basketball.</p>
