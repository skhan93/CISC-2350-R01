    <div class="menuitem">The short arm shot is common among mid-range shooters, who are afraid of shooting the ball too hard and donâ€™t follow all the way through. It adds difficulty to the shot, because they can finish in so many different positions.</div>

    <h2><center>The Science of Shooting</center></h2>
    <p>There is no one correct way of shooting a basketball, although there are certain elements of basketball shooting form common to all good basketball shooters that may be identified.
    <br>
    <br>

   	Shooting a basketball is also a science because it involves such mechanical processes as depth perception, velocity, angle of release, and trajectory of the ball in flight.

    <h2><center>Scoring</center></h2>

    <ul>
    	<li>3 points - Awarded to players who successfully shoot the ball through the hoop from behind the three-point line.</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>2 points - Awarded to players who successfully shoot the ball through the hoop from anywhere inside the three-point line. This can be done by shooting a jump shot, laying the ball into the rim, or slamming the ball through the hoop.</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>1 point - When players are fouled, they get free attempts to shoot the ball, which are called foul shots. A player is given one point for every successful foul shot.</li>
    </ul>
